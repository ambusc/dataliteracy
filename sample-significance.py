For example, you survey 200 employees on their preferences for remote work, and use their responses to infer that the whole firm would, on average, respond the same way. The 200 employees would be your sample, and you would draw a conclusion about the whole firm (the population).')

'Case closed‚Ä¶or not? What does it ___really___ mean when someone says a result is "significantly higher" or "significantly lower"?'

'__Significance__ (or the p-value) is the probability of a result occurring by chance, not due to the causal relationship you‚Äôre studying. The lower the p-value, the stronger inference you can make. You may see this number set at 0.05% or 0.01%. When reviewing reports, keep an eye out for p-value. The person presenting the data should always show this number, especially if they are trying to prove a causal relationship. 

Essentially, significance level is a way of measuring the reliability of the data. How strong is your inference?
